# camera-control-js
A node.js wrapper for the .net CameraControl library provided by digiCamControl

This is my attempt to wrap the digiCamControl library with a node.js wrapper using edge-js as the go-between.  My hope is that a simpler frontend can be made and that cross-platform support might be achieved and this is a project to explore the possibilities.

I have specific designs to employ this in my own research with photogrammetry. I use digiCamControl to monitor 120 camera rig and coordinate their exposure settings as well as download images once captured.
